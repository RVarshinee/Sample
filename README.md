# Text-to-Image Synthesis:
This project enables the generation of realistic images from textual descriptions using advanced deep learning techniques. The system leverages state-of-the-art models such as stable diffusion and transformer architectures to translate textual prompts into visually compelling images. Whether describing a scene, an object, or an abstract concept, the text-to-image synthesis pipeline allows users to effortlessly create visual representations from their imagination.

# Usage:
* To run this code, simply open the provided Google Colab file and change runtime type to T4 GPU and execute it.
* The code utilizes GPU acceleration for faster training and generation of output. There is no need to install any additional software or dependencies.

# About Google Colab
* Google Colab provides a free cloud-based Python development environment with built-in support for GPU acceleration.
* By running the code in Google Colab, users can take advantage of the GPU for faster training and inference without the need for specialized hardware.

# How to Use
* Open the provided Google Colab file (text_to_image_synthesis.ipynb).
* Click on Connect -> Change runtime type -> T4 GPU and then click Save.
* Run each cell in the ipynb file to see the output generated by each cell.

# Notes
* The code is designed to be run in Google Colab for GPU acceleration.
* Feel free to experiment with different textual prompts to generate a variety of images.
* Check the comments within the code for more information on each step of the text-to-image synthesis process.
